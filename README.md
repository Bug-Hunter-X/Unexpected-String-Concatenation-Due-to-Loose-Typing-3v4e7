This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug stemming from the language's loose typing system. The `foo` function intends to add two numbers, but due to type coercion, it performs string concatenation when one of the arguments is a string.  The solution shows how to explicitly type-check or use the `Number()` function to avoid this issue.
